# headings

The `headings` module defines font sizes for base-level heading elements from
`h1` through to `h6`.

## Dependencies

The `headings` module depends on one other module:

* [tools.mixins](https://github.com/treeframework/tools.mixins)

If you install the `headings` module using Bower or npm, you will get these 
dependencies at the same time. If not using Bower or npm, please be sure to 
install and `@import` these dependencies in the relevant way.

## Installation

You can install the `headings` module via Bower, npm, or copy and paste.

### Install using Bower:

```sh
$ bower install treeframework-headings --save
```

Once installed, `@import` into your project in its Object layer:

```scss
@import "bower_components/tree-headings/base.headings";
```

### Install using npm:

```sh
$ npm install tree-headings --save
```

### Install via file download

The least recommended option for installation is to simply download
`_base.headings.scss` into your project and `@import` it into your project in
its Object layer.
